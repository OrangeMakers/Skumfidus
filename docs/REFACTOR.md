# Refactoring Suggestions for SystemState and Handler Functions

## 1. Potential Issues

### 1.1 Unhandled Situations in HOMING State
- The HOMING state doesn't handle the scenario where the homing switch is never triggered. This could lead to indefinite movement in one direction.
- Illustration:
  ```
  HOMING
    |
    v
  Move towards home
    |
    v
  [Homing switch never triggers]
    |
    v
  Continues moving indefinitely
  ```

### 1.2 Potential Loop in RUNNING State
- The RUNNING state doesn't explicitly handle the scenario where the timer expires exactly when the stepper reaches an end position.
- Illustration:
  ```
  RUNNING
    |
    v
  Check timer and move stepper
    |
    v
  [Timer expires and stepper reaches end simultaneously]
    |
    v
  Potential ambiguity in next state transition
  ```

### 1.3 Lack of Error Handling in RETURNING_TO_START State
- The RETURNING_TO_START state doesn't handle potential errors during the return movement, such as unexpected obstacles or mechanical issues.
- Illustration:
  ```
  RETURNING_TO_START
    |
    v
  Move towards start position
    |
    v
  [Unexpected obstacle encountered]
    |
    v
  No error handling, continues attempting to move
  ```

## 2. Simplification Suggestions

### 2.1 Unified State Transition Function
- Implement a single `transitionState(SystemState newState)` function to handle all state transitions. This can centralize logging, display updates, and any common actions needed for state changes.

### 2.2 Separate Timer Logic
- Extract timer-related functionality into a separate Timer class or module. This can simplify the RUNNING state logic and make the timer functionality more reusable and testable.

### 2.3 Consolidate Homing Switch Checks
- Create a dedicated function for homing switch checks that can be called from multiple states. This can reduce code duplication and centralize the debounce logic.

### 2.4 Implement State-Specific Setup and Cleanup
- For each state, create `enter<StateName>()` and `exit<StateName>()` functions to handle state-specific setup and cleanup. This can make the main loop cleaner and ensure proper initialization for each state.

### 2.5 Use Enum Class for SystemState
- Convert the `SystemState` enum to an `enum class` for type safety and to avoid potential naming conflicts.

### 2.6 Implement a State Machine Pattern
- Consider implementing a proper state machine pattern. This could involve creating a base State class and derived classes for each system state, encapsulating state-specific behavior.

These refactoring suggestions aim to improve code organization, reduce complexity, and enhance error handling in the system. Implementing these changes should lead to a more robust and maintainable codebase.
